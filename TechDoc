       <a name="Angel Food Cake"></a>
       <p>Angel food cake, or angel cake, is a type of sponge cake made with egg whites, flour, and sugar. A whipping agent, such as cream of tartar, is commonly added. It differs from other cakes because it uses no butter. Its aerated texture comes from whipped egg white. Angel food cake originated in the United States and first became popular in the late 19th century, reaching its peak popularity in the early 2000s. It gained its unique reputation along with its name due to its light and fluffy texture.    </p>

       <p> Mathematical equations aren't just useful — many are quite beautiful. And many scientists admit they are often fond of particular formulas not just for their function, but for their form, and the simple, poetic truths they contain.   </p>
